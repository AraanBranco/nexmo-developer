# User

The concept of a User exists in Nexmo APIs, you can associate one with a user in your own application if you choose. A user can have multiple memberships to conversations and can communicate with other users through various different mediums.

A person who will communicate via a Conversation must first have a User object created. A User can be thought of as an endpoint for communication. When the User object is created it is assigned a unique user ID.
