# Member

Memberships connect Users with Conversations. When a User joins a Conversation a Member is created. Each Membership has one Conversation and one User. However, a User can have many Memberships to Conversations just as Conversations can have many Members.

Each Member has a unique Member ID of the form:

```
MEM-df8e57d8-1c8e-4573-bf4d-29d5414dcb42
```

Memberships can be created in various ways: via the REST API, using the functions provided by the SDKs, or using the command line.
